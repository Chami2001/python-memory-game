A memory puzzle game is a type of game designed to test and improve a player's memory skills. Typically, it involves a set of cards or tiles laid face down on a surface. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they will disappear; if not, they are turned face down again. The goal is to remember the positions of the cards and match all pairs in the fewest moves possible. These games can vary in complexity and theme, often featuring images, numbers, or patterns to match.
